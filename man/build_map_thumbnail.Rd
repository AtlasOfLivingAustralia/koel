\title{internal function to build maps}
\usage{
build_map_thumbnail(list_row, cache_path)

build_map_thumbnail(list_row, cache_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{list_row}{A `data.frame` object with a single row from a data.frame
produced by `ala_record_download()`. Usually the larger data.frame is
parsed through build_email, where it is then filtered twice to get down to
one row. Must at least contain 'recordID', decimalLatitude' and
'decimalLongitude' columns as these are used for plotting of the point on
the map and naming of the produced .png file.}

\item{cache_path}{A `character string` containing the path to the temporary
cache folder in which species images and maps are saved.  Must begin with
"./" and end  with "/". When this function it is called it should contain
a 'species_images' and a 'maps'. This function saves images in `cache_path/maps/`}
}
\value{
No returned file. Instead, a .png version of the produced thumbnail i
   is saved in the 'maps' directory of 'cache_path'.
}
\description{
use basemaps from OpenStreetMaps, called via `maptiles`

This function uses basemaps from OpenStreetMaps, called via `leaflet`,to
   produce small map thumbnails that depict the locations of individual
   observations extracted from ALA. These images are saved as .png files and
   imported into a `gt` table for rendering in a markdown document.
