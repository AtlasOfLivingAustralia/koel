}
\arguments{
\item{alerts_data}{A `data.frame` ideally produced by `ala_record_download()`.
Each row contains ALA data pertaining to a single species occurrence record
downloaded with galah. Should contain 29 default columns plus an extra
logical column for each list in the dataset.}

\item{email_list}{A `data.frame` of email details for each list. Should
contain at least two columns, one named 'email' containing email addresses,
and one named 'list' containing the lists each email is associated with.}

\item{email_subject}{An optional `character string` of the subject of the email.
If not provided, default subject is "ALA Biosecurity Alerts".}

\item{email_send}{A `character string` providing the email address from which
the alerts are to be sent.}

\item{email_password}{A `character_string` providing the password for the
provided email address (`email_send` argument)}

\item{email_host}{A `character_string` providing the email server host to be
fed to the `{emayili}` function `server()`. Defaults to
"smtp-relay.gmail.com" which supports the offocial ALA biosecurity alerts
email address.}

\item{email_port}{A `numeric` value providing the email server port to be
fed to the `{emayili}` function `server()`. Defaults to `587` which
supports the offocial ALA biosecurity alerts  email address.}

\item{template_path}{A `character string` containing the path to the R
markdown template to be rendered with the html table produced by
`build_gt_table()`}

\item{cache_path}{A `character string` containing the path to the temporary
cache folder in which species images and maps are saved.  Must begin with
"./" and end  with "/". Should contain a 'species_images' and a 'maps'
directory, however these will be created if they do not exist.}

\item{output_path}{An optional `character string` containing the path to the
permanent directory in which the produced .html and .csv files are saved
for record-keeping purposes. Default value is `NULL`, and files are only

\description{
This function compiles the downloaded ALA species occurrences into an
   informative table for each biosecurity list, and facilitates the sending
   of emails containing these tables to relevant addressees. It uses helper
   (internal and external) functions to format and compile necessary map
   images, format the table, and send the emails. There is no outputted value
   of this function, however it provides the option to save .html and .csv
   files to local or temporary directories.
